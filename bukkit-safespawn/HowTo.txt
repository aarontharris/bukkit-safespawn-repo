# Features:
# - Safe Zones
# - Magic Signs
# - - Teleportation
# - - Lock / Unlock chests & access control
# - PVP enabled after sun down.
#
# Coming soon:
# safespawn.vampirism // if you are infected, sunlight hurts your skin for 3 minecraft days, contact with others can spread infection. 
# safespawn.plague // if you are infected, you slowly drain life for 3 minecraft days, contact with others can spread infection.
# Tied teleporters // two signs with a matching symbol that teleport to each other no matter where they are.
# Dowsing rod for diamonds or gold or redstone etc
#
# Fix:
# Make magic signs and their chests explode proof
# 
# Ideas:
# - ability to heal plague or vampirism?
# - add things to gain experience faster, maybe a well?
# - add things you can do with experience aka magic?
# - an altar - when buttons are pressed in a specific order and the user has enough xp, an object is produced - maybe a monster egg?
# - an altar - "Sticks" and "Stones" may break my "Bones" but words will never hurt me.
# - - if you put 2 or more sticks, 2 or more stone blocks and 2 or more bones into a container
# - - you get a surprise!
#
# - Teleporters should not support absolute teleport coordinates
# - Teleporters can only teleport between paired teleporters (same markings and same owner)
# - Teleporters obey access rules
#
# - Iron Doors should obey access rules 
#
# Access rules:
# - Ownership is not the same as having access
# - - Only the owner may destroy owned blocks
# - - Only the owner may grant access to owned blocks
# - - If you do not log in for 3 months, the first name in the access list that has logged in in less than 3 months becomes the owner
# - - If you are the only player with access, the block becomes unowned.
# - - By default the owner has access, but if the owner /revokes access, the block becomes public
