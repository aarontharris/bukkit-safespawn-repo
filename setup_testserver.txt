# First you will need the CraftBukkit source code:
git clone git@github.com:Bukkit/CraftBukkit.git

# Once you have that checked out, you'll need to unpack the testserver.tgz in the CraftBukkit/ root folder
tar xvfz ./testserver.tgz <CraftBukkitHome>/

# Now import CraftBukkit into eclipse and use <CraftBukkitHome>/run.sh to start it
